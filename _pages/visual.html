    <h2>Relais Ristori</h2>
    <h3>graphic design, concept, communication</h3>
    <p>Relais Ristori is a boutique hotel in the heart of Verona, in which I have been working as a hotel manager for almost two years. I have been asked to redesign its whole image and to raise its visibility online. The logo has been redesigned and the website created from scratch using Wordpress, so that the owners would have been able to add contents as they wanted. During the years I managed their social channels and the website, until middle 2016.</p>
